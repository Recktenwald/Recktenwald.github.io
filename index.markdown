### About Me
I finished my PhD in Mathematics in December 2019 at the University in Freiburg. [Here is a link to my thesis](https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/165780). I also wrote a preprint about the model category part of my thesis, which is my personal favorite part. It is on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10531).
I am currently employed as a Data Scientist with a focus on market risks in commercial banks.
